# FAQs

## What is repo structure

I'll have a **client** directory for frontend, **server** directory for backend.

## What is tech stack

### For frontend

1. NextJs: it can be react but for easier route setup and to avoid using
   react-query
2. Typescript: to avoid error and to make use of type checking (e.g. enums)
3. Styledcomponents Why? Because I may add animations and other stuff in the
   future.
4. tailwind: for easier positioning, box model and that stuff
5. That's it for now, in the future I'll add more
